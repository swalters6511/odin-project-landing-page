# odin-project-landing-page

  In this project, Odin Project Landing Page, I will be creating an entire web page from a design provided by The Odin Project. The design provided comes in the form of 2 
images:

- one is an image of the completed website

- the second has information about fonts & colors used in the website.

   My goal is to get my project as close as possible to the design, without the
requirement of the webpage being an exact replica of the design. The purpose of this 
project is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or 
less the right position.
